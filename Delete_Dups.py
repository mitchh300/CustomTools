## This script is meant to be imported into an ArcGIS script. The purpose of the tool is to delete duplicate
## records in a specific field.  A checkbox is included in the script to check for duplicate geometries.
## Both a specific field AND the duplicate geometry checkbox should not be selected at one time. This tool was
## built as a replacement for the 'Delete Identical (Data Management)' tool found in the ArcGIS Advanced License package.
